abstract: The performance of a vibratory shear enhanced processing (VSEP) unit used to treat waste generated from a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX) process is assessed. The unit was fitted with a NF-270 membrane (97% nominal rejection of MgSO4) with an internal membrane surface area of 37 m2. The vibration amplitude of the module was set at 12.7 mm. The system removes greater than 97% dissolved organic carbon as well as 70 − 85% multivalent solutes (Mg2+, Ca2+, SO42−) from the MIEX waste. The permeate generated was high in salt and was successfully recycled to reduce the brine requirement for MIEX resin bead regeneration. Early operation in recirculating batch mode examined the effect of volumetric recoveries (in the permeate) ranging from 75–85%. Higher recovery had no significant influence on the performance of the system. System chemical cleaning was carried out every 14–16 batches. Batch durations generally extended in each subsequent cycle prior to cleaning, with the last batches taking up to five times longer than the first batch. The installation of VSEP has resulted in a reduced frequency of waste disposal from the facility and has also reduced the amount of make-up brine required for resin regeneration by 78%.
