abstract: 'In this paper, we demonstrate the highly efficient photo-switching ability of a Cu-azobenzene tetracarboxylate MOF (JUC-62) for low-energy CO2 capture. Under UV light irradiation, both at 273 and 298â€‰K, JUC-62 showed 51% and 34% lower CO2 uptake, respectively, than when UV light was off. Its dynamic CO2 uptake also matched well with its static condition. Storing it at ambient condition was also found not to destroy its framework structure and its dynamic photoswitching property could still be maintained.'
