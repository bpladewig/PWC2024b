abstract: The inherent property of palladium to form hydride is effectively exploited for the removal of adsorbed stabilizer and capping agents. Formation of hydride on exposure of Pd nanoparticles to sodium-borohydride weakens the metal's interaction with the adsorbed-impurities and thus enables their easy removal without compromising the shape, size and dispersion.
