abstract: A chiral, octahedral M12L12 cage, which is charge neutral and contains an internal void of about 2000 Å3, is reported. The cage was synthesised as an enantiopure complex by virtue of amino-acid-based dicarboxylate ligands, which assemble around copper paddlewheels at the vertices of the octahedron. The cage persists in solution with retention of the fluorescence properties of the parent acid. The solid-state structure contains large pores both within and between the cages, and displays permanent porosity for the sorption of gases with retention of crystallinity. Initial tests show some enantioselectivity of the cage towards guests in solution.
