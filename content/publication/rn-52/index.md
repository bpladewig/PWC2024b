abstract: 'Waste PLA can be upcycled to metal organic frameworks of potential high value in a one-pot synthesis scheme, where PLA depolymerisation occurs in situ. Three homochiral lactate based frameworks were successfully synthesised and characterised from PLA as a feed source, including ZnBLD. The chiral separation ability of ZnBLD was maintained.'
