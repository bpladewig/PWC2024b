abstract: A new course was designed to attract chemical and bioengineers to additive manufacturing and to provide them with an effective approach to this new field. The goal is a wider use of the advantages of additive manufacturing for complex multifunctional components in chemical process engineering. We describe the structure of the course and the experiences from the first two years. Students show great interest and are able to develop their own functional components with assistance. Yet many have deficits in the use of CAD software, which will be remedied in the future through a specific lecture.
