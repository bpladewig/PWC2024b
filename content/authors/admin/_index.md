## About Me

Professor of Energy Process Engineering and Paul Wurth Chair at the University of Luxembourg, leading activities in hydrogen-related materials and systems.

I was previously a research group leader in the Institute for Micro Process Technology (IMVT) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, developing novel in-situ diagnostic techniques for micro-structured process devices, including reactors, heat exchanges, membrane systems and photochemical reactors. 

Experienced in developing research concepts, securing funding, recruiting research students, publishing outcomes, obtaining protection for intellectual property, and closing out projects.

Keen lecturer and member of the Chemical Engineering community, in particular through the Institution of Chemical Engineers, of which I am a Fellow (FIChemE). Also a Chartered Engineer (CEng) and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC). Proud former Chevening Scholar and Humboldtian.
