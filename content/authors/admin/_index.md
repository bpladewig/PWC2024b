      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Professor of Energy Process Engineering and Paul Wurth Chair at the University of Luxembourg, leading activities in hydrogen-related materials and systems.

I was previously a research group leader in the Institute for Micro Process Technology (IMVT) at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, developing novel in-situ diagnostic techniques for micro-structured process devices, including reactors, heat exchanges, membrane systems and photochemical reactors. 

Experienced in developing research concepts, securing funding, recruiting research students, publishing outcomes, obtaining protection for intellectual property, and closing out projects.

Keen lecturer and member of the Chemical Engineering community, in particular through the Institution of Chemical Engineers, of which I am a Fellow (FIChemE). Also a Chartered Engineer (CEng) and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC).
